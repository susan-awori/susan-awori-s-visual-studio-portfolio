              Cow, Grass & Lion – Strategy Game
              <span class="badge">Live</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Cow, Grass & Lion – Strategy Game A JavaScript-based strategy game
              inspired by the ecosystem food chain, reimagining the classic
              Rock–Paper–Scissors mechanic through biological interactions. Core
              Concept: Players compete using a cyclic food-chain logic: Lion
              beats Cow, Cow beats Grass, and Grass beats Lion — simulating the
              balance of nature in a fun, interactive way. Key Features: Custom
              in-game console for real-time results (no browser alerts)
              Interactive 3D-style buttons with hover and active states
              Color-coded feedback for wins and losses Fully responsive design
              for mobile, tablet, and desktop Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3
              (Flexbox & animations), JavaScript (ES6, DOM manipulation & event
              handling) Role: Designed and developed the full game experience —
              UI, game logic, and responsiveness.

              ScanPay – Dynamic QR Code Payment Solution<span class="badge"

              >
            </h3>
            <p>
              ScanPay is a front-end and UX case study designed to demonstrate a
              modern solution to common retail payment challenges using dynamic,
              transaction-specific QR codes. The project focuses on delivering a
              fast, reliable, and mobile-first payment experience optimized for
              real-world usage. The core objective of the project was to
              showcase strong front-end integration, thoughtful user experience
              design, and technical reliability. This included seamless camera
              and QR scanning integration, a low-friction single-screen user
              flow, and consistent performance across different devices and
              browsers. Key UX and technical highlights include instant QR
              scanning with fast decoding and rear-camera priority, deployment
              in a secure HTTPS environment to ensure full camera compatibility,
              clean interface logic that displays only one view at a time,
              realistic payment simulation with generated KES transaction
              values, and a fully mobile-first design suitable for retail
              environments. The technology stack consists of HTML5 for semantic
              structure, CSS3 for responsive and mobile-first styling with
              customizable themes, JavaScript (ES6) for core logic, state
              management, and DOM manipulation, and the html5-qrcode library for
              reliable camera and QR functionality. The user flow begins with
              the application requesting camera permission and opening the
              scanner. Upon successful QR detection, the camera stops
              automatically and the transaction details appear for confirmation.
              Once confirmed, a simulated network delay leads to a final success
              message, mimicking a real payment process. Throughout development,
              the project followed the Conventional Commits standard to maintain
              a clear and organized version history, separating new features,
              bug fixes, and UI improvements. Role: Designed and developed the
              complete experience, including UX strategy, interface design, and
              full front-end implementation.

            <h3>UzaLeo – Modern Seller Onboarding Landing Page</h3>
            <p>
              UzaLeo is a high-conversion, responsive single-page marketing
              website created for a seller onboarding platform. The project
              focuses on delivering a professional, engaging, and fast user
              experience that guides potential sellers through the platform’s
              value and process, ending with a strong call-to-action. The
              interface was designed with a modern visual style using a
              high-contrast color palette and the Inter font family to create a
              clean and trustworthy brand impression. The layout is fully
              responsive, built with CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure a seamless
              experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Key
              features include a grid-based testimonial section for displaying
              social proof in a simple and stable format, smooth animated
              scrolling for section navigation, and interactive form feedback
              that improves user engagement even on a static page. The project
              emphasizes accessibility and SEO through the use of clean,
              semantic HTML5. The technology stack consists of HTML5 for
              structure, CSS3 for responsive styling and layout, and JavaScript
              (ES6+) for interactivity such as smooth scrolling and form
              handling. The project was built using only vanilla front-end
              technologies to ensure high performance and broad accessibility.
              Role: Designed and developed the full landing page experience,
              from UI design and UX flow to front-end implementation.

            <h3>Interactive Calendar Web Application</h3>
            <p>
              This project is a clean, interactive, and fully responsive
              calendar application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is
              designed to accurately display and navigate dates while
              maintaining a simple, intuitive user experience. The calendar
              allows users to move seamlessly between months and years using
              clear navigation controls. It dynamically calculates the correct
              number of days for each month and aligns the grid to the
              appropriate starting weekday. The current date is visually
              highlighted, helping users quickly orient themselves within the
              calendar. The layout adapts smoothly across different screen
              sizes, making the application usable on both desktop and mobile
              devices. The application is built using HTML5 for structure, CSS3
              for visual design and responsive layout, and modern JavaScript
              (ES6+) for all date logic, including current date detection, month
              calculations, and dynamic rendering. This project is actively
              under development and evolving into a full organizational tool.
              Planned features include event creation and viewing, task
              management with to-do lists, and persistent data storage using the
              browser’s local storage, allowing users to retain information even
              after closing the application. Role: Designed and developed the
              entire application, including UI design, front-end logic, and
              responsive behavior.
